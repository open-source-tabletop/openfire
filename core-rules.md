**Open Fire**
=============

Version: 0.3

## Introduction

Open Fire is an 'open source' tabletop wargame system that enables players to enact battles from any setting, at any scale. Players use miniatures to represent different fighting forces, taking turns to move and fight with each of them across a tabletop battlefield.

This book provides the core rules required to play and must be paired with a game module, an expansion that provides rules for different settings, scales, and armies. Open Fire is free to use and adapt for anyone that wishes to make use of the rules.

**Section 1 - Core Rules**
=============================

## What You Will Need

In order to play a game of Open Fire you are going to need a few things:

- The core rules found in this book.
- A game module for the setting you want to play.
- The miniatures to represent your forces on the tabletop.
- A space to represent your battlefield, a few square feet is enough for a small game.
- Some terrain to fill your battlefield.
- Some different coloured 12 sided dice.
- A ruler marked in inches.

## Models and Units

### Definitions

Whatever game module you choose you will need something to represent your forces on the tabletop. You may encounter a wide variety of miniatures in different styles and scales but any miniatures mounted on a single base are referred to in the rules as a **model**. Measuring is done from the base of a model rather than any part of the miniature. Some models may not be mounted on a base at all and this is only permitted where there is an obvious "footprint" for the model which counts as its base.

Models may move and act on their own or as part of a group of similar models: this is called a **unit** and every model is part of exactly one unit - even if that unit only consists of one model.

### Unit Profiles

Every unit has a profile which provides a list of models in the unit, their equipment, weapons, and other information. Each model has a set of **attributes** which are detailed in the unit profile.

These attributes are:

- **[MOV] Movement Rate**: The distance the model can move in inches.
- **[SKL] Battle Skill**: The skill this model has with its weapons.
- **[DEF] Defence Skill**: The model's armour and natural toughness.
- **[CMD] Command Skill**: The models ability to weather the stresses of battle.
- **[HP] Hit Points**: The amount of damage a model can take before being destroyed.
- **[Special] Special Rules**: These modify how the models operate in the game.

### Formation

Units must always have a model designated as the **leader**, throughout the game every model in the unit must stay in close proximity to the leader, this is called being in **formation**. You may choose any model in each unit to be the leader but it must be easily identifiable to all players and may not change once the game has started.

To be in formation all models must be within 4 inches horizontally of the leader, each change in height level counts as one additional inch. The unit leader must be able to see every model in the unit: using the rules for line of sight the unit leader must have a clear or obstructed line of sight to every model in the unit (you may ignore other models in the same unit).

### Assault Range

All models have an area extending 1 inch around them called their **Assault Range**. A model is within assault range of an enemy (and vice versa) if they are within 1 inch of each other.

### Facing and Arcs

It is often important to know which direction a model is facing, for moving or making attacks, and to know where other models are in relation to it. To this end a model has a **forward facing**, typically dictated by the direction the miniature itself is facing, and an opposite **backward facing**. If the forward facing is not obvious you should mark a point on the model's base or agree with your opponent which direction is forward.

Models also divide the area around them into four 90 degree sections called arcs. Imagine an X positioned over the model aligned with it's forward facing: the **front arc** is aligned with the forward facing, the **rear arc** is aligned with the backward facing, and the two side arcs the **left arc**, and **right arc** are aligned at 90 degrees to the left and right respectively.

**Attack origin** is the arc of a target model that an attack is being made from, i.e. where the attacking model is in relation the unit. The attack origin is always calculated from the unit leader. If the leader is between two arcs then it counts as being in the front-most arc. So the front arc takes priority over side arcs and side arcs take priority over rear arcs. Any attacks made from a unit within assault range always count as being in the front arc.

### Friendly and Enemy

Some rules will specify that they only affect models or units of a certain alignment, or relationship, to a player or unit. **Friendly** refers to any other unit or model belonging to the same player while **enemy** refers to any unit or model belonging to an opposing player.

### Weapons

In order to fight, your models require weapons and these will be listed in their unit profiles. Each weapon also has its own set of attributes, which describe how it functions in the game. Sometimes weapons will have more than one profile and the player should select just one profile to use when making an attack.

- **[RNG] Range**  
The range of the weapon tells you that you may target enemy units with this weapon if they are within that number of inches. Sometimes a range has 2 numbers and this indicates a minimum as well as maximum range at which the weapon can be used.
- **[ATT] Attacks**  
The attacks attribute represents the volume and intensity of an attack from this weapon. This will determine how many dice you roll for this weapon when making an attack.
- **[DMG] Damage**
The damage attribute tells you how destructive a hit from this weapon is, each successful hit from a weapon can cause this amount of damage to an enemy's hit points, though they will get to try and reduce this.
- **[PRC] Piercing**  
The piercing attribute tells you how effective this weapon is at getting through armour or defences. This reduces the ability of your target to defend against taking damage.
- **Special Rules**  
Special rules modify how the weapon works including some rules that only trigger when you have a critical success.

### Abilities

Abilities are special actions that a unit can perform during their activation that are in addition to the normal moving and attacking actions. The details of what an ability does is given in a unit's profile including any conditions that must be met to use the ability.

### Stress Level

Stress is an important part of Open Fire, as units come under heavier fire it affects their ability to fight. Stress is measured by adding a number of stress tokens, or a dice marking stress level, next to your unit - typically black dice or tokens are used for stress. At the end of each round, after every unit has finished their activation, each player must check to see if their units gain stress tokens. Any unit that took damage during the round takes one stress, though they may never have more than 3 at any time.

Each stress token on your unit causes you to suffer a -1 modifier to your **Movement Rate** and **Battle Skill Tests**.

### Other Markers

During a game you will also need to track how many hit points models have remaining after they have taken damage. It is usually best to place a red die beside the unit that indicates the remaining hit points so that it is clearly visible to all players.

You may also wish to place markers next to units throughout a round to indicate which units have been activated, make sure to use a marker that cannot be mixed up with your opponent or other tokens being used in the game.

## Dice Rolls and Measuring

### 12 Sided Dice

Open Fire uses 12 sided dice to determine the outcome of many actions, often abbreviated as D12. 

### Skill Tests

The most common dice roll you will perform is called a **Skill Test**, which involves a simple roll of a d12 which is then compared to the named skill from a unit's attributes: **Battle Skill**, **Defence Skill**, or **Command Skill**.

- If the result is less than the attribute it is a **failure**, a roll of 1 is always a failure regardless of modifiers.
- If the result equals or exceeds the attribute value it is a **success**.
- Any result of a 12 is considered a **critical success** and is always considered a success.

**Modifiers** often apply to a skill test, effectively increasing or decreasing the value rolled (for example, a +1 modifier will turn a roll of a 6 into a 7). When multiple modifiers apply these are cumulative and the final modifier should be worked out before rolling the dice. A modified roll of 12 does not count as a critical success, only a physical roll of 12 counts as a critical success.

### Re-rolls

You may sometimes be permitted to **re-roll** a dice, if you do so you must take the second result even if it is worse and you may never re-roll a dice more than once.

### Roll-Offs

The other type of dice roll that you typically use is called a **roll off**. Both players roll a die and the player that rolls the highest value wins the roll-off, with any ties being re-rolled.

### Measuring Distances

To measure a distance from a model you measure from the closest point on the base (or footprint) to the closest point on the base of the model or object you are measuring to. You may measure anything at any time so long as doing so does not interfere with something your opponent is doing or unnecessarily slow down the game.

### Within Range

Many rules require a model to be **within** a certain range, whether for making an attack, securing an objective, or deploying from reserves. A model is within so long as the distance between the closest points of the models or object is not more than the specified range.

## Making Attacks

When a unit takes an attack action you begin by declaring which models in your unit will target which enemy units. Before rolling any dice for the attack you need to determine which **line of sight** your model has to it's target, if they are **in range** and are a **valid target**. You may change which models are targetting which units will checking this but once you start rolling dice for an attack you may no longer change targets.

### Line of Sight

For each target unit you select any model in your attacking unit that is targeting that unit and check, from the perspective of the model (i.e. by bending down and looking through the model), to see if it can see models in the enemy unit. The result of this check will be either **clear**, **obstructed**, or **blocked**. You can ignore models in the same unit when determining the line of sight.

- If you can see at least 1 model for every 3 models in the target without any terrain obstructing any part of the models then the attacking unit has a **clear** line of sight to that target.
- If you can see at least 1 model for every 3 models in the target but one or more are at least partially obscured by terrain then you have an **obstructed** line of sight to that target.
- If you cannot see any part of any model due to intervening terrain then you have a **blocked** line of sight.

### Check Range

For every model in your attacking unit you need to check that it is **in range** to it's target. Measure the distance between the model and the nearest model that is at least partially visible to your unit as determined when checking line of sight.

### Valid Targets

There are some situations that will restrict your choice of target enemy units when making an attack:

- If you are within assault range of one or more enemy unit you may only select those units as your target.
- If your target unit is within assault range of another friendly unit you may not select that unit as your target unless you are also in assault range of that unit.
- If your target unit is partially obstructed by any friendly or enemy unit from the perspective of any of the models in the attacking unit you cannot select that unit as your target unless you are also in assault range of that unit.

### Assault Weapons

Not all weapons are effective, or easy to use, within assault range: weapons that do not have the **Assault** special rule only hit on a critical success against enemies in assault range.

## Armies

When players play a game of Open Fire they each bring a number of units with which to fight, these are called the players **armies** (though a module may specify a more appropriate term). Each module will provide different rules for determining which models each player can bring.

## Missions

Every time you play a game of Open Fire you play a **mission**. The mission provides information about how your models will deploy onto the battlefield, the main objectives of the game, and any other information you might need. Each mission is detailed in a **mission profile**.

### Entry Points and Reserve

When you start a game you begin with each of your units off the table ready to deploy onto the battlefield. These units are considered in **reserve**. Each mission profile will provide the location of a number of **entry points** for each player. These should be marked on your battlefield with a token as they are where your units will enter the game.

### Deploying Units

As your units do not begin on the battlefield they must be **deployed** from reserve. When it is a player's turn to activate a unit they may choose a unit already on the battlefield or one in reserve. If they choose a unit in reserve it is placed within 6 inches of one of that player's entry points and then activates as normal.

Some restrictions apply to deploying your models:

- Unless another rule permits it, each player must deploy all of their units on the battlefield during the first turn.
- If a unit cannot be placed within 6 inches of an entry point then it cannot be deployed. If it must be deployed but cannot be placed then it is destroyed.
- If a round ends with a player having no units on the battlefield, even if they still have some in reserve, then that player immediately forfeits the game.

### Objectives

Objectives are strategic objects or positions on the battlefield that may need to be held, recovered, destroyed or otherwise accessed. Each objective is marked on the battlefield with a small token or model around 40mm wide. Each objective will provide a number of **victory points** for being secured according to the mission profile. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner.

When a unit is within 1 inch of an objective, and do not have any enemy units within their assault range, they can use the **secure** action. If no other enemy units are within 1 inch of the objective marker then the marker is secured for that player. The mission profile will indicate how many objectives are to be included, what kind of objective they should be, how many points players will score for each objective, and which players may secure them.

Objectives can be one of the following four types:

- **Control**: Once a control objective is secured, it remains secured so long as at least 1 unit from the securing army stays within 6 inches of the objective.
- **Destroy**: Once a player has secured this objective it must remain secured until the end of the next round at which point it is destroyed and removed from the battlefield.
- **Access**: Once this objective is secured it is immediately scored and removed from the game.
- **Recover**: Once this objective is secured the unit that secured it must survive until the end of the battle to score any victory points from it. If the unit that secured the objective is destroyed the objective is destroyed.

## Resolving Issues

With a game freeform and potentially complex as Open Fire there may be times when you are not sure on the correct way to resolve a situation. It is usually best to keep playing and agree to a simple resolution (or roll-off to see who gets to decide) and search for the correct answer after the game.

## Playing a Game

To make it easier to play, the game is broken down into stages, which are further broken down into various steps. A game of Open Fire will go as follows:

1. **Pre Game**
    1. Before sitting down to play a game of Open Fire you and your opponent must agree on which game module you wish to play and gather your miniatures and other components.
2. **Set Up Stage**
    1. Choose a Mission.
    2. Set Up Terrain.
    3. Set Up Entry Points, Objectives, and Control Points.
3. **Battle Stage**
    1. Collect Activation Markers.
    2. Determine Initiative Order.
    3. Alternate Activating Units.
    4. Check for Stress.
4. **Post Game**
    1. After the last round of the battle stage players then calculate their victory points and determine the outcome of the game.

**Section 2 - Playing a Game**
==============================

## Set Up Stage

### Choose Mission

Before you can set up your battlefield you must choose a mission, as this may affect how you set up your table. You can agree an appropriate mission with your opponent, or randomly determine which mission to play. Once you have determined your mission the mission profile will tell you if there are any specific rules for setting up your terrain.

Your chosen mission will also tell you how many rounds the game will last and the number and position of entry points and objectives.

### Set Up Terrain

Your chosen mission may include some guidance on setting up your terrain but most will allow you to set up your terrain from your collection as you see fit. Try to include a mix of terrain such as large line of sight blocking elements and smaller, cover-providing scatter pieces. If one player sets up all the terrain, then the other player should be provided an opportunity to modify the setup.

### Set Up Entry Points and Objectives

Your mission profile will instruct you on where to place each entry point and objective marker. If your terrain stops you from placing a marker in the exact correct place either adjust the terrain or agree with your opponent on the best, nearest position for the objective. Some missions will allow players some freedom in placing their entry points, in these cases players should first roll-off, and then alternate placing an entry point each starting with the player that won the roll-off.

## Battle Stage

### Rounds

The battle stage of the game is where players will have a chance to move and fight with each of their units through a number of rounds. Unless otherwise specified a game lasts for 6 rounds. Each round follows a set of steps as outlined below.

#### Collect Activation Markers

As you activate units each round you will place a marker next to them to help identify which units have, and have not, been activated. From the second round onwards you begin the round by removing all these markers ready to begin again.

#### Determine Initiative Order

Before activating any units, players must roll-off to determine which player will get the first activation this round.

#### Players Alternate Activating Units

Starting with the player that won the roll-off for initiative, players take it in turns to choose a unit that has not yet been activated this turn and perform a number of actions with it. After it has completed its actions a marker should be placed next to the unit to indicate that it has completed its actions for this turn.

#### Check for Stress

Starting with the player that won the roll-off for initiative, each player will add a stress token to every unit that took damage during this round.

## Actions

When a unit is activated it may perform the following actions in order:

- **Recover**: the unit can attempt to remove stress levels it has accrued.
- **Abilities**: the unit may use any abilities it has.
- **Move**: the unit will have an opportunity to move across the battlefield.
- **Attack**: the unit may be able to make an attack against an enemy unit.
- **Secure**: the unit may be able to secure an objective.

### Action: Recover

Before you take any actions you start by rolling a **Command Test** for each stress level on your unit. For each successful command test you reduce your stress level by 1. If any of your command tests are a **Critical Success** you remove all stress tokens from the unit.

### Action: Abilities

At the start of its activation, a unit may use one ability following the rules for the ability as listed in the unit's profile.

### Action: Move

When moving a unit, begin by moving the leader model up to its **movement rate** in inches. When moving a model it is always moved forward in a straight line, but can stop and change direction at any point so long as the total distance moved does not exceed the model's movement rate. Once the leader has been moved you then may move the other members of the unit, other models are simply moved to any position that is in formation with the leader - you do not need to measure the movement of other models.

A model may not voluntarily move off the board at any point during a move action and other members of a unit may not be placed off the board after the leader moves. A model may not move over the base of any enemy models, if it moves over the base of a friendly model it must finish its move so that the bases are not overlapping.

#### Leaving Assault Range

If at any point a unit **leaves** the **assault range** of an enemy unit, that enemy unit may make a free **attack action** against this unit. Every model in the unit may make an attack though the attack counts as being in **assault range**.

#### Advance Moves

A unit may choose to move faster than normal, at the expense of their ability to make attacks, this is called an **advance** move. If a unit chooses to make an advance move it may move an additional 6 inches on top of its normal movement rate.

#### Terrain

A model cannot move through terrain objects and instead must move around them or over them following the rules for different kinds of terrain. To understand how your terrain works Open Fire uses a simple system of keywords. A keyword may apply to a whole piece of terrain or to specific parts of your terrain. Make sure all players know which keywords apply to the terrain before playing. You will find a full list of terrain keywords in the Advanced Rules section.

When you have terrain that has different height levels, you should assign each clear area a **height level**. The lowest level is always considered height 0 and each height level counting up is typically around 1-2 inches. Models may only ascend height levels where there is climbable terrain that connects the two height levels. If you have terrain that is different levels but not any significant change then it should be the same height level as the nearest area, allowing models to freely move across small changes.

### Action: Attack

A unit that wishes to attack enemy units must first choose which enemy units will be targeted and by which models in your unit following the rules for making attacks in section 1. Each model in your unit may attack with only one of its weapons. A unit that made an **advance move** may only make attacks with **Assault** weapons.

Once you have determined your targets and line of sights you follow the attack procedure outlined below. You can follow this procedure for each model in your unit or you can combine attacks from model with the same battle skill using the same weapon to speed up the process. Repeat the process until you have made all of your attacks.

#### Step 1 - Roll Attacks

To determine if each attack hits the target unit you roll a number of **battle skill tests** equal to the **attacks** attribute of the weapon being used. If you are making multiple attacks with the same weapon against the same unit you may roll the combined number of these attacks together. For each test that equals or beats the attacking model's **battle skill** attribute that attack is a hit.

The following standard modifiers apply to your battle skill test:

- -2 if you made an advance move.
- -4 if you have an obstructed line of sight.

#### Step 2 - Roll Defence

For each successful hit against a target unit that player must take a **defence test** for each point of **damage** the attacking weapon has. The **defence test** dice roll is reduced by the attacking weapons **piercing** attribute.

#### Step 3 - Apply Damage

For each failed defence test the target unit will suffer damage. Choose any model in your unit, except the leader unless it is the only model remaining, and reduce its **Hit Points** by the amount of damage your unit sustained. If that model is reduced to 0 Hit Points remove it from the game and select another model to receive the remaining damage. Continue doing this until you have assigned all the damage you have taken to models or until every model in the unit has been removed.

If a model takes damage, but is not reduced to 0, place a die next to the model showing how many hit points it has remaining. If your unit takes damage and has a model that has already taken damage in a previous attack, you must assign any new damage to that model first.

### Action: Secure

If a unit is within 1 inch of an objective, and has no enemy units within its assault range, it can attempt to secure that objective as covered in Section 1.

**Section 3 - Advanced Rules**
==============================

## Vehicles

Models with the **Vehicle** special rule are subject to the following additional rules.

### Moving

Instead of being able to freely pivot when moving, vehicles turn by making a **manoeuvre**, turning up to 45 degrees on the spot. Vehicles may make one free manoeuvre each time they take a movement action and may do so at any point during their movement. A vehicle may make additional manoeuvres at the cost of 2 inches of their allowed movement. They must have sufficient remaining movement to make these additional manoeuvres. If a vehicle wishes to make an advance move it may not make more than 1 manoeuvre.

### Attacking

When taking an attack action vehicles may use every weapon they are equipped with and may target different units with each.

### Attacking a Vehicle

As vehicles are typically larger targets than infantry they only count as being obscured if more than half of the model is hidden behind terrain. In addition vehicles have the **Vulnerable (Rear Arc)** special rule.

### Restrictions

- Vehicles may not climb on climbable terrain and may only ascend or descend from terrain levels if they have the fly special rule.
- Vehicles may only move forward or backward during their activation but not both on the same activation.
- Vehicles count their **movement rate** as half when moving backward.
- Vehicles do not get to make a free attack action against units that leave their **assault range**.
- Vehicles which have lost more than half of their original hit points are less effective in battle. As such they suffer -2 to their **movement rate** and suffer a -2 penalty to all attribute tests.
- Vehicles cannot secure objectives.

## Transports

Models with the **Transport (X)** special rule can carry other models across the battlefield with the following rules. The value of X indicates how many models may be carried by a transport.

### Embarking and Disembarking

In order to embark on a transport a unit leader must move, or already be, within 1 inch of the transport. You then remove the unit from the table as it is embarked on the transport, if you are using a lot of transports you will need to make it clear to your opponent which units are embarked on which transports. A unit which embarks on a transport does so after moving and so can not make an attack or secure any objectives during its activation.

When a unit disembarks (gets out) from a transport the leader is placed within 1 inch of the transport and may then be activated as normal. The leader may not be placed in **assault range** of an enemy unit when it disembarks.

### Destroyed Transports

If a unit is embarked on a transport when it is destroyed the unit leader is placed within 1 inch of the transport before it is removed, with the rest of the unit placed in formation. Any model which cannot be placed in formation, or that must be placed within the assault range of an enemy model is removed as a casualty. If the leader cannot be placed then the entire unit is removed as a casualty. 

### Restrictions

- A transport may only carry friendly models that do not have the **Vehicle**, **Transport** or **Bulky** special rules.
- A transport may carry multiple units so long as it can accommodate every model in each unit.
- A unit may not embark and disembark a transport during the same activation and may only embark or disembark during its own activation.

## Aircraft

Models with the **Aircraft** special rule count as having the **Vehicle**, **Flying**, and **Support** special rules. They are also subject to the following additional rules.

### Aircraft Movement

When making a movement action, aircraft may only move forward, never backward. The **movement rate** for aircraft is always given as a range showing their minimum and maximum movement. An aircraft model must always move up to their minimum movement. If for any reason they are not able to move up to their minimum movement they are destroyed and removed from the battlefield.

If an aircraft has it's **Movement Rate** modified this only affects the vehicles maximum movement rate.

### Leaving the Battlefield

Aircraft models are permitted to leave the battlefield during their movement. Aircraft that leave the battlefield are still subject to the **Support** special rule when activating from reserve.

## Terrain Keywords

The following keywords can be applied to different parts of your terrain to define how they work in the game.

### Clear

This keyword applies to any area on your terrain on which models can be placed and move as normal, this is usually for walkways, the tops of hills and so on. Terrain is only clear if the model can be securely placed on it, if a model has a base that is too large or is otherwise restricted then the terrain is considered impassable.

### Climbable

Climbable usually refers to an area of vertical terrain that connects two different height levels or that can be climbed over. Models can move up climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of their allowed movement for each level ascended. Models may climb down climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of their allowed movement for every 2 full levels descended (so climbing down 1 level is free). Models may only climb up or down if they have sufficient movement to complete their movement on clear terrain or on an unobstructed area of the battlefield.

### Impassable

Models cannot climb over or move through this piece of terrain.

### Barrier

Terrain with the **barrier** keyword may be moved across at the cost of 1 inch of allowed movement, in addition to the distance travelled. Models may not finish their movement on a barrier.

### Slow

The slow keyword should only be applied to an area that models can move through. All movement through slow terrain counts as double the distance actually travelled.

**Section 4 - Special Rules**
=============================

Special rules are a set of modifiers to how models operate within the game. The rules presented here are universal and will usually only be included in a unit profile by name.

Some special rules have a value indicated in their title, such as Heavy Armour (X), where X can be different values for each unit. When a unit has this rule it will be given with a value in place of the X, substitute this value in the text of the special rule.

## Unit Special Rules

### Ambush

Instead of deploying as normal, models with this rule may choose to deploy anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 12 inches from an enemy model. If they choose to do so they do not make the free 6 inch movement.

### Bulky

This model may not embark upon a **Transport** model.

### Fast

Models with this special rule may move 9 inches during an advance move instead of the normal 6.

### Fear (X)

Units within 6 inches of this unit suffer a -X to **command tests**.

### Fearless

This unit may re-roll any failed **command tests**.

### Flying

Models with this rule are not affected by intervening terrain when they move, and may freely move across the bases of other models so long as they finish their movement so no bases are overlapping. This unit does not count any change in height towards its total distance moved.

### Heavy Armour (X)

Models with this rule reduce the **damage** and **piercing** value of attacks made against it by X. The damage value cannot be reduced below 1 and the piercing value cannot be reduced below 0.

### Inspiring Presence

Friendly units within 6 inches of this unit count as having the **Skilled** and **Fearless** special rule.

### Manoeuvrable (X)

Vehicles with this rule may make X additional free manoeuvres during its activation, including when making an advance move.

### Resilient

This model may re-roll any failed **defence tests** that do not roll a 1.

### Rugged

This model ignores the penalty for travelling through **slow** terrain.

### Skilled

This unit may re-roll any **Battle Skill** test that do not roll a 1.

### Skirmishers

This unit has its formation range increased to 8 inches.

### Slow

This unit may never make an Advance move.

### Stealth (X)

When targeting a unit that is not within **assault range** with this rule you suffer a -X modifier to your **battle skill test**.

### Vulnerable (X)

This unit suffers a -2 to **defence tests** when the attack origin is in the given arc X.

### Support

Models with this rule do not need to be deployed on the first turn and may instead be held in reserve. From the second turn onwards the unit must make a successful **command test** to be deployed. If the test is failed the unit still counts as having activated and the player may not activate a different unit.

## Weapon Special Rules

### Accurate

When making an attack with this weapon your **battle skill test** has a +2 modifier if you did not move this activation.

### Assault

This weapon can be used against an enemy within assault range without having to roll a critical success.

### Blast

Attacks with this weapon count an obscured line of sight as clear. This weapon can also target enemy units that are partially obscured by other units.

### Grenade

A unit may only use one weapon with this rule per activation.

### Heavy

A unit may not attack with this weapon if it moved during its activation.

### Impact

A weapon with this rule counts a critical hit as two hits.

### One Use

This weapon may only be used once per battle.

### Rapid Fire

Weapons with this rule get +1 to their **attacks** attribute when their target unit is within half of the weapons maximum range.

### Rending (X)

Weapons with this rule automatically cause X damage when they hit with a critical success before the enemy unit rolls any defence tests. This is in addition to any normal damage the attack may do.

### Torrent

An attack with this weapon automatically hits with each attack. Attacks should still be rolled where a critical success may trigger a benefit.

### Unstable

When making an attack with this weapon, any rolls of a 1 cause the weapon to explode, killing the model making the attack outright.

### Unwieldy

Weapons with this rule suffer -2 to the **battle skill test** when making an attack.
