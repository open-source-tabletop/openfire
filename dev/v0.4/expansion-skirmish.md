Open Fire Expansion: Skirmish
=============================

Version 0.3

## About

Skirmish is an expansion for Open Fire that provides additional rules suitable for small scale battles, typically with 5-15 models per army with each acting independently in the fight.

## Type Keywords

Skirmish games focus mainly on individual infantry type models and most of the rules only apply to models with the infantry type.

# Additional Rules

The following additional rules are used in games with the Skirmish expansion.

## Units and Models

In skirmish games every unit may only contain one model, if you are applying the skirmish rules to an existing game module simply treat every model as it's own unit after creating your army.

## Attacks

Unless otherwise specified a model may only target a model for an attack if it is within its front arc.

## Advanced Movement

These additional movement rules are available to models with the infantry type.

### Jumping

Models which wish to move between two areas of terrain at the same height, or to an area 1 height level lower, that is separated by a gap of up to 2 inches may attempt to jump the gap. Move the model to the edge of the terrain you wish to jump from as normal and check to see if the model can make the jump.

Roll a D12 for each full inch of distance being jumped (rounding up), if any of the results are a 1 the model fails the jump and stops it's movement before the gap and it's activation ends immediately.

### Hidden Movement

Models may attempt to move quietly while making the most of any available cover, a model which moves but does not make an advance move or an attack may have a token placed next to it marking it as hidden. Any attacks against this model with an obscured line of sight count as having a blocked line of sight until the model's next activation when the marker is removed. If an enemy model moves within 6 inches of this model it removes the hidden token.

## Injuries

As infantry type models take damage their ability to fight is reduced. In addition to tracking a model's hit points they can also become hurt or wounded You may place a dice beside the model to show this with 1 indicating the model is hurt and 2 indicating it is wounded.

The effect of each injury is cumulative so a model that is wounded also suffers the penalty for being hurt.

### Hurt

Models which have been reduced to below half of their starting hit points become hurt, this causes them to suffer a -1 to their movement rate, skill, and defence attributes.

### Wounded

Models which are reduced to 1 hit point are wounded and may not make an attack action if they move. In addition they may not make an advance move during their movement.

### Killing a Model

Infantry models which are reduced to 0 hit points are not automatically killed and may survive to keep fighting. When a model would lose its last hit point instead make a defence roll: on a successful roll the model is restored to 1 hit point, on a failed roll the model is removed as a casualty.

# Special Rules

The following additional special rules are available for game modules using the Skirmish Rules.

## Weapon Rules

### Any Arc

This weapon may be used to target enemy models in the front and rear arc.
