Open Fire Expansion: Vehicles
=============================

Version 0.3.1

## About

This expansion provides additional rules covering vehicles and how they differ in movement, attacks and other actions. It also includes rules for transports and aircraft which further expand the role of vehicles within your games.

## Type Keywords

Models which have the "vehicle" type may use the rules for vehicles, models with the "transport" type use both the transport and vehicle rules, while models with the "aircraft" type use both the aircraft and vehicle rules. Models with the "infantry" type may be carried in transport vehicles.

# Vehicles

Models with the vehicle type are subject to the following additional rules.

## Vehicle Movement

Instead of being able to freely pivot when moving, vehicles turn by making manoeuvres, turning up to 45 degrees on the spot. Vehicles may make one free manoeuvre each time they take a movement action and may do so at any point during their movement.

A vehicle may make additional manoeuvres at the cost of 2 inches of their allowed movement. They must have sufficient remaining movement to make these additional manoeuvres.

If a vehicle wishes to make an advance move it may not make more than 1 manoeuvre.

## Vehicle Attacks

When taking an attack action vehicles may use every weapon they are equipped with and may target different units with each.

## Attacking a Vehicle

As vehicles are typically larger targets than infantry they only count as being obscured if more than half of the model is hidden behind terrain.

## Vehicle Restrictions

- Vehicles may not climb on climbable terrain and may only ascend or descend from terrain levels if they have the fly special rule.
- Vehicles may only move forward or backward during their activation but not both on the same activation.
- Vehicles count their movement rate as half when moving backward.
- Vehicles do not get to make a free attack action against units that leave their assault range.
- Vehicles which have lost more than half of their original hit points are less effective in battle. As such they suffer -2 to their movement rate and suffer a -1 penalty to all attribute rolls.
- Vehicles cannot secure objectives.

# Transports

Transports are a type of vehicle that can carry other models across the battlefield. A model with the transport type also counts as having the vehicle type and may carry models with the infantry type.

## Transport Capacity

The number of models a transport is determined by the Capacity (X) special rule: see the additional special rules below.

## Embarking and Disembarking

In order to embark on a transport a unit leader must move, or already be, within 1 inch of the transport. You then remove the unit from the table as it is embarked on the transport, if you are using a lot of transports you will need to make it clear to your opponent which units are embarked on which transports. A unit which embarks on a transport does so after moving and so can not make an attack or secure any objectives during its activation.

When a unit disembarks from a transport the leader is placed within 1 inch of the transport and may then be activated as normal. The leader may not be placed in assault range of an enemy unit when it disembarks.

## Destroyed Transports

If a unit is embarked on a transport when it is destroyed the unit leader is placed within 1 inch of the transport before it is removed, with the rest of the unit placed in formation. Any model which cannot be placed in formation, or that must be placed within the assault range of an enemy model is removed as a casualty. If the leader cannot be placed then the entire unit is removed as a casualty. 

## Restrictions

- A transport may only carry friendly models with the infantry type.
- A transport may carry multiple units so long as it can accommodate every model in each unit.
- A unit may not embark and disembark a transport during the same activation and may only embark or disembark during its own activation.

# Aircraft

Aircraft are a specific kind of vehicle that is capable of moving freely over the battlefield, ignoring units and terrain below it. A model with the aircraft type also counts as having the vehicle type.

## Aircraft Reserve

Aircraft may be held in reserve and deployed on any turn you wish, however you must pass a successful command roll to bring the onto the battlefield. If this roll is failed this still counts as activating a unit and play moves onto the next player.

## Aircraft Movement

When making a movement action, aircraft may only move forward, never backward. An aircraft model must always move up to half of their total allowed movement. If for any reason they are not able to move up to half of their movement they are destroyed and removed from the battlefield.

If an aircraft has it's movement rate modified this only affects the vehicles maximum movement rate, it must still move a minimum of half it's original movement rate.

Aircraft also count as having the Flying special rule and may ignore intervening terrain and models so long as their base can be placed on clear terrain at the end of their movement.

## Leaving the Battlefield

Aircraft models are permitted to leave the battlefield during their movement and go back into reserve if they do so.

## Vehicle Transports

It is possible to have aircraft also use the transport rule with the following modifications:

- An aircraft transport may not move in the same round that units embark or disembark, likewise a unit may not embark or disembark an aircraft transport on a round in which it moved.
- An aircraft transport may not leave the battlefield if it has models embarked, if it does so both the aircraft and embarked unit are destroyed.
- If an aircraft transport is destroyed while units are embarked, all models embarked on the transport are also destroyed.

# Vehicle Expansion Special Rules

## Capacity (X)

This transport may carry up to X infantry type models.

## Manoeuvrable (X)
