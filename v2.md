Open Fire
=========

## Welcome to Open Fire

Open Fire is an 'open source' tabletop wargame system that enables players to enact battles from any setting, at any scale. Players use miniatures to represent different fighting forces, taking turns to move and fight with each of them across a tabletop battlefield.

This book provides the core rules required to play and must be paired with a game module, an expansion that provides rules for different settings, scales, and armies. Open Fire is free to use and adapt for anyone that wishes to make use of the rules.

Section 1 - Getting Started
==============================

## Rules, Modules, and Extensions

Open Fire is modular in its approach to rules: these core rules provide a foundation upon which game modules and expansions build complete, yet familiar, games.

Game modules provide information about a setting, unique rules for a game, and most importantly the army lists available for that module. This tells players what forces and miniatures they can choose and how they are represented in the game.

Expansions represent a specific set of additional rules which may not be suitable for every game. This allows game modules to use a set of common components that players are already familiar without reinventing them each time.

While some of this may sound confusing, in practice it's very simple, you have a set of rules for how to play and a set of rules for what you can play with. Some modules may even combine all the parts that they use into one single reference document.

## Miniatures

Open Fire is, at it's core, a miniatures game, though it is very flexible in terms of scale and style of miniatures. In fact, in most games you could easily use tokens to represent your forces, especially if you want to test out a new game module.

## The Battlefield

In order to play a game you are going to need a space to represent your battlefield, and usually some kind of terrain to fill it. Many games can be played on a kithen table though some can require a much larger space to be played, tables up to around 6ft by 4ft being about the largest commonly used. The terrain you need will obviously depend on the game you are playing for it's scale and style but should fill roughly 1/3 of your available space with large and small pieces.

## Missions

Every time you play a game of Open Fire you play using a mission, this tells you the goal of the game, the objectives each player has, how long the game lasts, and so on. A very simple mission may simply see both players line up across the table from each other and fight to see who does the most damage, however most provide a scenario which tasks players with more specific goals and allows players to build a narrative around their games.

## Dice

Open Fire uses 12 sided dice to determine the outcome of many actions, often abbreviated as D12. 

### Attribute Rolls

The most common dice roll you will perform is called an attribute roll, which involves a simple roll of a D12 which is then compared to the named attribute: a skill roll, defence roll, and command roll.

- If the result of the roll is less than the attribute it is a failure.
- If the result equals or exceeds the attribute value it is a success. 

Modifiers often apply to an attribute roll, effectively increasing or decreasing the value rolled (for example, a +1 modifier will turn a roll of a 6 into a 7). When multiple modifiers apply these are cumulative and the final modifier should be worked out before rolling the dice. A roll of a 1 on the dice always counts as a failure and a roll of a 12 always counts as a success, regardless of modifiers.

### Re-rolls

You may sometimes be permitted to re-roll a dice, if you do so you must take the second result even if it is worse and you may never re-roll a dice more than once.

### Roll-Offs

The other type of dice roll that you typically use is called a roll off. Both players roll a die and the player that rolls the highest value wins the roll-off, with any ties being re-rolled.

## Measuring

You will oftend need to measure distances in Open Fire, when moving a unit or checking the distance between them for making attacks. You will need a ruler marked in inches for this.

To measure a distance from a model you measure from the closest point on the base (or footprint) to the closest point on the base of the model or object you are measuring to. You may measure anything at any time so long as doing so does not interfere with something your opponent is doing or unnecessarily slow down the game.

When measuring for movement you should always make sure that no part of the model moves more than the distance you have measured, do this by always measuring from the same part of the model.

Many rules require a model to be within a certain range, whether for making an attack, securing an objective, or deploying from reserves. A model is within so long as the distance between the closest points of the models or object is not more than the specified range.

## Resolving Issues

There may be times when you are not sure on the correct way to resolve a situation. It is usually best to keep playing and agree to a simple resolution (or roll-off to see who gets to decide) and search for the correct answer after the game.

Section 2 - Units and Armies
============================

## Models and Miniatures

Whatever game module you choose you will need something to represent your forces on the tabletop. You may encounter a wide variety of miniatures in different styles and scales but the game treats these the same way: any miniature, or group of miniatures, that is mounted on a single base is called a model.

Models may move and act on their own or as part of a group of similar models: this is called a unit and every model is part of exactly one unit - even if that unit only consists of one model.

Measuring is done from the base of a model rather than any part of the miniature. Some models may not be mounted on a base at all and this is only permitted where there is an obvious "footprint" for the model which counts as its base.

## Unit Profiles

Every unit has a profile which provides a list of models in the unit, their equipment, weapons, and other information. Each model has a set of attributes which are detailed in the unit profile.

These attributes are:

- **[Mov] Movement**: The distance the model can move in inches.
- **[Att] Skill**: The skill this model has with its weapons when making an attack.
- **[Def] Defence**: The model's armour, toughness, or ability to evade attacks.
- **[Str] Strength**: The strength or ability of the model to directly cause damage.
- **[Cmd] Command**: The models ability to weather the stresses of battle.
- **[HP] Hit Points**: The amount of damage a model can take before being destroyed.
- **[Special] Special Rules**: These modify how the models operate in the game.
- **[Type] Type Keyword**: These are keywords that identify a model as being of a specific type, these are often used by other rules to further specify which models they affect.

## Special Rules and Abilities

Special rules are additional rules that modify some aspect of the unit during the game, a set of universal special rules are included in this book and are usually only provided in a unit profile by name. If the unit has it's own unique special rule the name and full description of how the rule works will be included in the unit profile.

Abilities are special actions that a unit can perform during their activation that are in addition to the normal moving and attacking actions. The details of what an ability does is given in a unit's profile including any conditions that must be met to use the ability.

## Weapons

In order to fight, your models require weapons and these will be listed in their unit profiles. Each weapon has its own set of attributes, which describe how it functions in the game. Sometimes weapons will have more than one profile and the player should select just one profile to use when making an attack.

- **[Rng] Range**: The distance from your target this weapon may be used.
- **[Att] Attacks**: The volume and intensity of an attack from this weapon.
- **[Dmg] Damage**: How destructive a hit from this weapon is.
- **[Prc] Piercing**: How effective this weapon is at getting through armour or defences.
- **Special Rules**: These modify how the weapon works in the game.

## Leaders and Formation

All unit must have a model designated as the leader, throughout the game every model in the unit must stay in close proximity to the leader, this is called being in formation. If not specified in the unit profile you may choose any model in a unit to be the leader, however it must be easily identifiable to all players and may not change once the game has started.

To be in formation all models must be within 4 inches horizontally of the leader, each change in height level counts as one additional inch. The unit leader must be able to see every model in the unit: using the rules for line of sight the unit leader must have a clear or obstructed line of sight to every model in the unit (you may ignore other models in the same unit).

## Facing and Arcs

It is often important to know which direction a model is facing, for moving or making attacks, and to know where other models are in relation to it. To this end a model has a forward facing, typically dictated by the direction the miniature itself is facing, and an opposite backward facing. If the forward facing is not obvious you should mark a point on the model's base or agree with your opponent which direction is forward.

Models also divide the area in around them into two zones: a line is drawn through the center of the model at 90 degrees to the forward facing, the area to the front of the model is called the front arc and the area to the back is called the rear arc.

A model is within another model's front arc if any part of it's base is within that area, otherwise it is in the rear arc. When dealing with units with multiple models this is calculated using the unit leaders.

## Assault Range

All models have an area extending 1 inch around them called their assault range. A model is within assault range of an enemy (and vice versa) if they are within 1 inch of each other.

## Friendly and Enemy

Some rules will specify that they only affect models or units of a certain alignment, or relationship, to a player or unit. "Friendly" refers to any other unit or model belonging to the same player while "enemy" refers to any unit or model belonging to an opposing player. Unless otherwise specified a rule which affects other "friendly" units does not also affect the unit with the special rule.

## Stress

Stress is an important part of Open Fire, as units come under heavier fire it affects their ability to fight. Stress is measured by adding a number of stress tokens, or a dice marking stress level, next to your unit.

At the end of each round, after every unit has finished their activation, each player must check to see if their units gain stress tokens. Any unit that took damage during the round takes one stress, though they may never have more than 3 at any time.

Each stress token on your unit causes you to suffer a -1 modifier to your movement and skill attributes. Each time a unit is activated it will have a chance to recover from these effects.

### Markers

During a game you will also need to track how many hit points models have remaining after they have taken damage. It is usually best to place a red die beside the unit that indicates the remaining hit points so that it is clearly visible to all players.

You may also wish to place markers next to units throughout a round to indicate which units have been activated, make sure to use a marker that cannot be mixed up with your opponent or other tokens being used in the game.

Section 3 - Playing a Game
==========================

## Stages

To make it easier to play, the game is broken down into stages, which are further broken down into various steps. A game of Open Fire will go as follows:

## Pre Game Stage

Before sitting down to play a game of Open Fire you and your opponent must agree on which game module you wish to play and gather your miniatures and other components.

## Set up Stage

The set up stage is where you will decide on a mission to play, set up your terrain and any marker points your need.

### Choose a Mission

Before you can set up your battlefield you must choose a mission, as this may affect how you set up your table. You can agree an appropriate mission with your opponent, or randomly determine which mission to play.

Once you have determined your mission the mission profile will tell you if there are any specific rules for setting up your terrain. Your chosen mission will also tell you how many rounds the game will last and the number and position of entry points or objectives.

You will find some basic missions included in this book with additional ones being included in game modules and expansions.

### Set Up Terrain

Your chosen mission may include some guidance on setting up your terrain but most will allow you to set up your terrain from your collection as you see fit. Try to include a mix of terrain such as large line of sight blocking elements and smaller, cover-providing scatter pieces. If one player sets up all the terrain, then the other player should be provided an opportunity to modify the setup.

### Entry Points and Reserve

When you start a game you begin with each of your units off the table ready to deploy onto the battlefield. These units are considered in reserve and will be brought onto the table at an entry point as they are activated. Each mission profile will provide the location of a number of entry points for each player and these should be marked on your battlefield with a token.

If your terrain stops you from placing a marker in the exact correct place either adjust the terrain or agree with your opponent on the best, nearest position for the objective. Some missions will allow players some freedom in placing their entry points, in these cases players should first roll-off, and then alternate placing an entry point each starting with the player that won the roll-off.

## Battle Stage

The battle stage of the game is where players will have a chance to move and fight with each of their units through a number of rounds. Unless otherwise specified a game lasts for 6 rounds. Each round follows a set of steps as outlined below.

## The Round

Each round follows a similar process of steps the players should follow:

1. Roll for initiative.
2. Alternate activions for units.
3. Check for stress.
4. Remove activation markers.

## Initiative

At the start of each round players roll-off to determine which order the players should go in activating their units. If you are playing with several players you should take note of this somewhere to avoid confusion.

## Activating Units

Starting with the player that won the roll-off for initiative, players take it in turns to choose one unit that has not yet been activated this turn and perform a number of actions with it. After it has completed its actions a marker should be placed next to the unit to indicate that it has completed its actions for this turn.

When a unit is activated it may perform the following actions in order:

- **Recover**: the unit can attempt to remove stress levels it has accrued.
- **Move**: the unit will have an opportunity to move across the battlefield.
- **Attack**: the unit may be able to make an attack against an enemy unit.
- **Secure**: the unit may be able to secure an objective.
- **Abilities**: the unit may use any abilities it has.

## Action: Recover

When you activate a unit that has accrued stress markers you can begin by testing to see if the unit recovers. Start by making a command roll for each stress marker on your unit. In the event of rolling a 12 you may remove all stress markers from that unit.

## Action: Movement

To move a unit, begin by moving the leader model up to its movement rate in inches. When moving a model it is always moved forward in a straight line, but can stop and change direction at any point so long as the total distance moved does not exceed the model's movement rate. Once the leader has been moved you then may move the other members of the unit which are simply moved to any position that is in formation with the leader - you do not need to measure the movement of other models.

A model may not voluntarily move off the board at any point during a move action and other members of a unit may not be placed off the board after the leader moves. A model may not move over the base of any enemy models, if it moves over the base of a friendly model it must finish its move so that the bases are not overlapping.

### Deploying Units

As your units do not begin on the battlefield they must be deployed from reserve. When it is a player's turn to activate a unit they may choose a unit already on the battlefield or one in reserve. If they choose a unit in reserve it is placed within 6 inches of one of that player's entry points and then activates as normal.

Some restrictions apply to deploying your models from reserve:

- Unless another rule permits it, each player must deploy all of their units on the battlefield during the first turn.
- If a unit cannot be placed within 6 inches of an entry point then it cannot be deployed. If it must be deployed but cannot be placed then it is destroyed.
- If a round ends with a player having no units on the battlefield, even if they still have some in reserve, then that player immediately forfeits the game.

### Assault Range

A model may freely move within the assault range of any other model. However, if at any point your unit leaves assault range of that enemy unit it may make a free attack action against your unit. This attack is worked out after you have finished your activation but does not count as the enemy unit being activated. Every model in the enemy unit may make an attack which counts as being in assault range.

### Advance Moves

A unit may choose to move faster than normal, at the expense of their ability to make attacks, this is called an advance move. If a unit chooses to make an advance move it may move an additional 6 inches on top of its normal movement rate, however it suffers a -4 to any skill rolls for the remainder of their activation.

### Terrain

A model cannot move through terrain objects and instead must move around them or over them following the rules for different kinds of terrain. To understand how your terrain works the game uses a simple system of keywords. A keyword may apply to a whole piece of terrain or to specific parts of your terrain. Make sure all players know which keywords apply to the terrain before playing. You will find a full list of terrain keywords in the Advanced Rules section.

When you have terrain that has different height levels, you should assign each clear area a height level. The lowest level is always considered height 0 and each height level counting up is typically around 1-2 inches difference. Models may only ascend height levels where there is climbable terrain that connects the two height levels. If you have terrain that is different levels but not any significant change then it should be the same height level as the nearest area, allowing models to freely move across small changes.

The following keywords can be applied to different parts of your terrain to define how they work in the game:

#### Clear

This keyword applies to any area on your terrain on which models can be placed and move as normal, this is usually for walkways, the tops of hills and so on. Terrain is only clear if the model can be securely placed on it, if a model has a base that is too large or is otherwise restricted then the terrain is considered impassable.

#### Climbable

Climbable usually refers to an area of vertical terrain that connects two different height levels or that can be climbed over. Models can move up climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of their allowed movement for each level ascended. Models may climb down climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of their allowed movement for every 2 full levels descended (so climbing down 1 level is free). Models may only climb up or down if they have sufficient movement to complete their movement on clear terrain or on an unobstructed area of the battlefield.

#### Impassable

Models cannot climb over or move through this piece of terrain.

#### Barrier

Terrain with the barrier keyword may be moved across at the cost of 1 inch of allowed movement, in addition to the distance travelled, however models may not finish their movement on a barrier.

#### Slow

The slow keyword should only be applied to an area that models can move through. All movement through slow terrain counts as double the distance actually travelled.

## Action: Attack

When a unit takes an attack action you begin by declaring which models in your unit will target which enemy units. Before rolling any dice for the attack you need to determine which line of sight your model has to it's target, if they are in range, and are a valid target. You may change which models are targetting which units while checking this but once you start rolling dice for an attack you may no longer change targets.

### Line of Sight

For each target unit you determine your line of sight through any model that is targeting that unit. Check, from the perspective of that model (i.e. by bending down and looking through the model), to see if it can see models in the enemy unit. The result of this check will be either clear, obstructed, or blocked.

You can ignore intervening models in the attacking and target units when determining line of sight.

- If you can see at least 1 model completely unobstructed for every 3 models in the target unit then you have a clear line of sight to that unit.
- If you can see at least 1 model for every 3 models in the target unit, but one or more of these are partially obscured by terrain or another enemy unit, then you have an obstructed line of sight.
- If any of the models in the enemy unit are partially obscured by a friendly unit, or if you cannot see any of the models in the enemy unit, then you have a blocked line of sight.

### Check Range

For every model in your attacking unit you need to check that it is in range to their chosen target. Measure the distance between the model and the nearest model that is at least partially visible to your unit as determined when checking line of sight. If it is equal to or less than the weapon's range attribute the model is in range and may perform an attack.

### Valid Targets

There are some situations that will restrict your choice of target enemy units when making an attack:

- If you are within assault range of one or more enemy unit you may only select those units as your target.
- If your target unit is within assault range of another friendly unit you may not select that unit as your target unless you are also in assault range of that unit.

### Assault Weapons

Not all weapons are effective, or easy to use, within assault range: weapons that do not have the Assault special rule suffer a -4 modifier to their skill roll.

### Attack Procedure

Once you have determined your targets and line of sights you follow the attack procedure outlined below. You can follow this procedure for each model in your unit or you can combine attacks from model with the same skill value using the same weapon to speed up the process. Repeat the process until you have made all of your attacks.

### Step 1 - Roll Attacks

To determine if each attack hits the target unit you make a number of skill rolls equal to the attacks attribute of the weapon being used. If you are making multiple attacks with the same weapon against the same unit you may roll the combined number of these attacks together.

For each skill roll that equals or beats the attacking model's skill attribute that roll is a hit.

The following standard modifiers apply to your skill roll:

- The skill roll has a -4 modifier if you made an advance move.
- The skill roll has a -4 modifier for using weapons without the Assault rule in assault range.

### Step 2 - Roll Defence

For each successful hit against a target unit that player must make a defence roll for each point of damage the attacking weapon has.

- The defence roll has a negative modifier equal to the attacking weapons piercing attribute.
- The defence roll has a +4 modifier if the attacker had an obscured line of sight.

#### Step 3 - Apply Damage

For each failed defence test the target unit will suffer damage. The target unit's owner chooses any model in that unit, except the leader unless it is the only model remaining, and reduces its hit points by the amount of damage your unit sustained. 

If that model is reduced to 0 hit points it is destroyed, remove it from the game and select another model to receive the remaining damage. Continue doing this until you have assigned all the damage you have taken to models or until every model in the unit has been removed.

If a model takes damage, but is not reduced to 0, place a die next to the model showing how many hit points it has remaining. If your unit takes damage and has a model that has already taken damage in a previous attack, you must assign any new damage to that model first.

## Action: Secure

Many missions require you to interact with objectives, objects on the battlefield that represent strategic objects or positions. Each objective is marked on the battlefield with a small token or model around 40mm wide. Each objective will provide a number of victory points for being secured according to the mission profile. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is declared the winner.

To use the secure action you need to be within 1 inch of an objective, and not have any enemy units within assault range. If no other enemy units are within 1 inch of the objective marker then the marker is secured. The mission profile will indicate how many objectives are to be included, what kind of objective they should be, how many points players will score for each objective, and which players may secure them.

Objectives can be one of the following four types:

- **Control**: Once a control objective is secured, it remains secured so long as at least 1 unit from the securing army stays within 6 inches of the objective.
- **Destroy**: Once a player has secured this objective it must remain secured until the end of the next round at which point it is destroyed and removed from the battlefield.
- **Access**: Once this objective is secured it is immediately scored and removed from the game.
- **Recover**: Once this objective is secured the unit that secured it must survive until the end of the battle to score any victory points from it. If the unit that secured the objective is destroyed the objective is destroyed.

## Action: Abilities

Some units will have special abilities which they can use during their activation, these will normally instruct you on when you may use the ability. Some actions will replace another action, for example you may perform an action instead of moving, in these cases you must perform those actions in the order of the action they replace.

## Check Stress

Once players have activated all of their units the next step is to check units for stress. Each player should add one stress token to every unit in their army that took damage this round.

## Remove Activation Markers

At the end of each round players should remove all the activation tokens from the battlefield ready for the next round.

## Ending the Game

Each game module and mission will provide different rules on how many rounds a game should last, unless otherwise specified a game lasts for 6 rounds. At the end of the game the player with the most victory points is declared the winner unless any round ends with one player having no units on the battlefield: in which case that player forfeits the game. If a round ends with both players having no units on the battlefield then neither player wins the game.


Section 4 - Special Rules
=========================

Special rules are a set of modifiers to how models operate within the game. The rules presented here are universal and will usually only be included in a unit profile by name.

Some special rules have a value indicated in their title, such as Heavy Armour (X), where X can be different values for each unit. When a unit has this rule it will be given with a value in place of the X, substitute this value in the text of the special rule.

## Unit Special Rules

### Ambush

Instead of deploying as normal, models with this rule may choose to deploy anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 12 inches from an enemy model. If they choose to do so they do not make the free 6 inch movement.

### Fast

Models with this special rule may move 9 inches during an advance move instead of the normal 6.

### Fear (X)

Units within 6 inches of this unit suffer a -X to command rolls, this is not cumulative with other models with the fear rule, use the largest value of X.

### Fearless

This unit may re-roll any failed command rolls.

### Flying

Models with this rule are not affected by intervening terrain when they move, and may freely move across the bases of other models so long as they finish their movement so no bases are overlapping. This unit does not count any change in height towards its total distance moved.

### Heavy Armour (X)

Models with this rule reduce the damage and piercing value of attacks made against it by X. The damage value cannot be reduced below 1 and the piercing value cannot be reduced below 0.

### Resilient

This model may re-roll any failed defence rolls that do not roll a 1.

### Rugged

This model ignores the penalty for travelling through slow terrain.

### Skilled

This unit may re-roll any skill rolss that do not roll a 1.

### Skirmishers

This unit has its formation range increased to 8 inches.

### Slow

This unit may never make an advance move.

### Stealth (X)

When targeting a unit that is not within assault range with this rule you suffer a -X modifier to your skill rolls.

### Support

Models with this rule do not need to be deployed on the first turn and may instead be held in reserve. From the second turn onwards the unit must make a successful command roll to be deployed. If the test is failed the unit still counts as having activated and the player may not activate a different unit.

## Weapon Special Rules

### Accurate

When making an attack with this weapon your skill roll has a +2 modifier.

### Assault

This weapon does not receive the -4 skill roll penalty against units in assault range.

### Blast

Attacks with this weapon count an obscured line of sight as clear.

### Grenade

A unit may only use one weapon with this rule per activation.

### Heavy

A unit may not attack with this weapon if it moved during its activation.

### One Use

This weapon may only be used once per battle.

### Rapid Fire

Weapons with this rule get +1 to their attacks attribute when their target unit is within half of the weapons maximum range.

### Rending (X)

Weapons with this rule automatically cause additional X damage when the skill roll is a 12.

### Torrent

An attack with this weapon hits on any skill roll that is not a 1 but may not be used within assault range.

### Unstable

When making an attack with this weapon, any skill rolls of a 1 cause the weapon to explode, killing the model making the attack outright.

### Unwieldy

Weapons with this rule suffer -2 to the skill roll when making an attack. and may not make free attacks against enemy units that leave engagement range.

Section 5 - Expansions
======================

Expansions are additional rules that are useful for specific types of game but that may not be used in every game module. A few core expansions are provided here with more advanced ones available separately where required.

# Expansion: Vehicles

This expansion provides additional rules covering vehicles and how they differ in movement, attacks and other actions. It also includes rules for transports, a specific type of vehicle that can carry other models, and aircraft, which have additional movement rules.

## Vehicles

Models with the vehicle type are subject to the following additional rules.

### Vehicle Movement

Instead of being able to freely pivot when moving, vehicles turn by making manoeuvres, turning up to 45 degrees on the spot. Vehicles may make one free manoeuvre each time they take a movement action and may do so at any point during their movement.

A vehicle may make additional manoeuvres at the cost of 2 inches of their allowed movement. They must have sufficient remaining movement to make these additional manoeuvres.

If a vehicle wishes to make an advance move it may not make more than 1 manoeuvre.

### Vehicle Attacks

When taking an attack action vehicles may use every weapon they are equipped with and may target different units with each.

### Attacking a Vehicle

As vehicles are typically larger targets than infantry they only count as being obscured if more than half of the model is hidden behind terrain.

### Vehicle Restrictions

- Vehicles may not climb on climbable terrain and may only ascend or descend from terrain levels if they have the fly special rule.
- Vehicles may only move forward or backward during their activation but not both on the same activation.
- Vehicles count their movement rate as half when moving backward.
- Vehicles do not get to make a free attack action against units that leave their assault range.
- Vehicles which have lost more than half of their original hit points are less effective in battle. As such they suffer -2 to their movement rate and suffer a -1 penalty to all attribute rolls.
- Vehicles cannot secure objectives.

## Transports

Transports are a type of vehicle that can carry other models across the battlefield. A model with the transport type also counts as having the vehicle type and may carry models with the infantry type.

### Transport Capacity

Every transport will have the following special rule:

#### Capacity (X)

This transport may carry up to X infantry models.

### Embarking and Disembarking

In order to embark on a transport a unit leader must move, or already be, within 1 inch of the transport. You then remove the unit from the table as it is embarked on the transport, if you are using a lot of transports you will need to make it clear to your opponent which units are embarked on which transports. A unit which embarks on a transport does so after moving and so can not make an attack or secure any objectives during its activation.

When a unit disembarks from a transport the leader is placed within 1 inch of the transport and may then be activated as normal. The leader may not be placed in assault range of an enemy unit when it disembarks.

### Destroyed Transports

If a unit is embarked on a transport when it is destroyed the unit leader is placed within 1 inch of the transport before it is removed, with the rest of the unit placed in formation. Any model which cannot be placed in formation, or that must be placed within the assault range of an enemy model is removed as a casualty. If the leader cannot be placed then the entire unit is removed as a casualty. 

### Restrictions

- A transport may only carry friendly models with the infantry type.
- A transport may carry multiple units so long as it can accommodate every model in each unit.
- A unit may not embark and disembark a transport during the same activation and may only embark or disembark during its own activation.

## Aircraft

Aircraft are a specific kind of vehicle that is capable of moving freely over the battlefield, ignoring units and terrain below it. A model with the aircraft type also counts as having the vehicle type.

### Aircraft Reserve

Aircraft may be held in reserve and deployed on any turn you wish, however you must pass a successful command roll to bring the onto the battlefield. If this roll is failed this still counts as activating a unit and play moves onto the next player.

### Aircraft Movement

When making a movement action, aircraft may only move forward, never backward. An aircraft model must always move up to half of their total allowed movement. If for any reason they are not able to move up to half of their movement they are destroyed and removed from the battlefield.

If an aircraft has it's movement rate modified this only affects the vehicles maximum movement rate, it must still move a minimum of half it's original movement rate.

Aircraft also count as having the Flying special rule and may ignore intervening terrain and models so long as their base can be placed on clear terrain at the end of their movement.

### Leaving the Battlefield

Aircraft models are permitted to leave the battlefield during their movement and go back into reserve if they do so.

## Vehicle Expansion Special Rules
