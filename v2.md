Open Fire
=========

## Welcome to Open Fire

Open Fire is an 'open source' tabletop wargame system that enables players to enact battles from any setting, at any scale. Players use miniatures to represent different fighting forces, taking turns to move and fight with each of them across a tabletop battlefield.

This book provides the core rules required to play and must be paired with a game module, an expansion that provides rules for different settings, scales, and armies. Open Fire is free to use and adapt for anyone that wishes to make use of the rules.

Section 1 - Getting Started
==============================

## Rules, Modules, and Extensions

Open Fire is modular in its approach to rules: these core rules provide a foundation upon which game modules and expansions build complete, yet familiar, games.

Game modules provide information about a setting, unique rules for a game, and most importantly the army lists available for that module. This tells players what forces and miniatures they can choose and how they are represented in the game.

Expansions represent a specific set of additional rules which may not be suitable for every game. This allows game modules to use a set of common components that players are already familiar without reinventing them each time.

While some of this may sound confusing, in practice it's very simple, you have a set of rules for how to play and a set of rules for what you can play with. Some modules may even combine all the parts that they use into one single reference document.

## Miniatures

Open Fire is, at it's core, a miniatures game, though it is very flexible in terms of scale and style of miniatures. In fact, in most games you could easily use tokens to represent your forces, especially if you want to test out a new game module.

## The Battlefield

In order to play a game you are going to need a space to represent your battlefield, and usually some kind of terrain to fill it. Many games can be played on a kithen table though some can require a much larger space to be played, tables up to around 6ft by 4ft being about the largest commonly used. The terrain you need will obviously depend on the game you are playing for it's scale and style but should fill roughly 1/3 of your available space with large and small pieces.

## Missions

Every time you play a game of Open Fire you play using a mission, this tells you the goal of the game, the objectives each player has, how long the game lasts, and so on. A very simple mission may simply see both players line up across the table from each other and fight to see who does the most damage, however most provide a scenario which tasks players with more specific goals and allows players to build a narrative around their games.

## Dice

Open Fire uses 12 sided dice to determine the outcome of many actions, often abbreviated as D12. 

### Attribute Rolls

The most common dice roll you will perform is called an attribute roll, which involves a simple roll of a D12 which is then compared to the named attribute: namely the Attack, Defence, and Command attributes.

- If the result of the roll is less than the attribute it is a failure.
- If the result equals or exceeds the attribute value it is a success. 

Modifiers often apply to an attribute roll, effectively increasing or decreasing the value rolled (for example, a +1 modifier will turn a roll of a 6 into a 7). When multiple modifiers apply these are cumulative and the final modifier should be worked out before rolling the dice. A roll of a 1 on the dice always counts as a failure and a roll of a 12 always counts as a success, regardless of modifiers.

### Re-rolls

You may sometimes be permitted to re-roll a dice, if you do so you must take the second result even if it is worse and you may never re-roll a dice more than once.

### Roll-Offs

The other type of dice roll that you typically use is called a roll off. Both players roll a die and the player that rolls the highest value wins the roll-off, with any ties being re-rolled.

## Measuring

You will oftend need to measure distances in Open Fire, when moving a unit or checking the distance between them for making attacks. You will need a ruler marked in inches for this.

To measure a distance from a model you measure from the closest point on the base (or footprint) to the closest point on the base of the model or object you are measuring to. You may measure anything at any time so long as doing so does not interfere with something your opponent is doing or unnecessarily slow down the game.

When measuring for movement you should always make sure that no part of the model moves more than the distance you have measured, do this by always measuring from the same part of the model.

Many rules require a model to be within a certain range, whether for making an attack, securing an objective, or deploying from reserves. A model is within so long as the distance between the closest points of the models or object is not more than the specified range.

## Resolving Issues

There may be times when you are not sure on the correct way to resolve a situation. It is usually best to keep playing and agree to a simple resolution (or roll-off to see who gets to decide) and search for the correct answer after the game.

Section 2 - Units and Armies
============================

## Models and Miniatures

Whatever game module you choose you will need something to represent your forces on the tabletop. You may encounter a wide variety of miniatures in different styles and scales but the game treats these the same way: any miniature, or group of miniatures, that is mounted on a single base is called a model.

Models may move and act on their own or as part of a group of similar models: this is called a unit and every model is part of exactly one unit - even if that unit only consists of one model.

Measuring is done from the base of a model rather than any part of the miniature. Some models may not be mounted on a base at all and this is only permitted where there is an obvious "footprint" for the model which counts as its base.

## Unit Profiles

Every unit has a profile which provides a list of models in the unit, their equipment, weapons, and other information. Each model has a set of attributes which are detailed in the unit profile.

These attributes are:

- **[MOV] Movement**: The distance the model can move in inches.
- **[ATT] Attack**: The skill this model has with its weapons when making an attack.
- **[DEF] Defence**: The model's armour, toughness, or ability to evade attacks.
- **[POW] Power**: The strength of the model, or it's ability to directly cause damage.
- **[CMD] Command**: The models ability to weather the stresses of battle.
- **[HP] Hit Points**: The amount of damage a model can take before being destroyed.
- **[Special] Special Rules**: These modify how the models operate in the game.

## Special Rules and Abilities

Special rules are additional rules that modify some aspect of the unit during the game, a set of universal special rules are included in this book and are usually only provided in a unit profile by name. If the unit has it's own unique special rule the name and full description of how the rule works will be included in the unit profile.

Abilities are special actions that a unit can perform during their activation that are in addition to the normal moving and attacking actions. The details of what an ability does is given in a unit's profile including any conditions that must be met to use the ability.

## Weapons

In order to fight, your models require weapons and these will be listed in their unit profiles. Each weapon has its own set of attributes, which describe how it functions in the game. Sometimes weapons will have more than one profile and the player should select just one profile to use when making an attack.

- **[RNG] Range**: The distance from your target this weapon may be used.
- **[ATT] Attacks**: The volume and intensity of an attack from this weapon.
- **[DMG] Damage**: How destructive a hit from this weapon is.
- **[PRC] Piercing**: How effective this weapon is at getting through armour or defences.
- **Special Rules**: These modify how the weapon works in the game.

## Leaders and Formation

All unit must have a model designated as the leader, throughout the game every model in the unit must stay in close proximity to the leader, this is called being in formation. If not specified in the unit profile you may choose any model in a unit to be the leader, however it must be easily identifiable to all players and may not change once the game has started.

To be in formation all models must be within 4 inches horizontally of the leader, each change in height level counts as one additional inch. The unit leader must be able to see every model in the unit: using the rules for line of sight the unit leader must have a clear or obstructed line of sight to every model in the unit (you may ignore other models in the same unit).

## Facing and Arcs

It is often important to know which direction a model is facing, for moving or making attacks, and to know where other models are in relation to it. To this end a model has a forward facing, typically dictated by the direction the miniature itself is facing, and an opposite backward facing. If the forward facing is not obvious you should mark a point on the model's base or agree with your opponent which direction is forward.

Models also divide the area in around them into two zones: a line is drawn through the center of the model at 90 degrees to the forward facing, the area to the front of the model is called the front arc and the area to the back is called the rear arc.

A model is within another model's front arc if any part of it's base is within that area, otherwise it is in the rear arc. When dealing with units with multiple models this is calculated using the unit leaders.

## Assault Range

All models have an area extending 1 inch around them called their assault range. A model is within assault range of an enemy (and vice versa) if they are within 1 inch of each other.

## Friendly and Enemy

Some rules will specify that they only affect models or units of a certain alignment, or relationship, to a player or unit. "Friendly" refers to any other unit or model belonging to the same player while "enemy" refers to any unit or model belonging to an opposing player. Unless otherwise specified a rule which affects other "friendly" units does not also affect the unit with the special rule.

## Stress

Stress is an important part of Open Fire, as units come under heavier fire it affects their ability to fight. Stress is measured by adding a number of stress tokens, or a dice marking stress level, next to your unit.

At the end of each round, after every unit has finished their activation, each player must check to see if their units gain stress tokens. Any unit that took damage during the round takes one stress, though they may never have more than 3 at any time.

Each stress token on your unit causes you to suffer a -1 modifier to your movement and attack attributes. Each time a unit is activated it will have a chance to recover from these effects.

### Markers

During a game you will also need to track how many hit points models have remaining after they have taken damage. It is usually best to place a red die beside the unit that indicates the remaining hit points so that it is clearly visible to all players.

You may also wish to place markers next to units throughout a round to indicate which units have been activated, make sure to use a marker that cannot be mixed up with your opponent or other tokens being used in the game.
