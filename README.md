Open Fire
=========

### An Open Source Wargaming System

Open Fire is an 'open source' tabletop wargame system that enables players to enact battles from any setting, at any scale. Players use miniatures to represent different fighting forces, taking turns to move and fight with each of them across a tabletop battlefield.

To play a game you need the core rules, which cover the basics mechanics of play, and a game module, which provides the setting, army lists, missions, campaign rules, etc. There are also a set of expansions to the core rules, these are common additions to the core rules which are applicable only to a specific type of game. This allows a game module to simply use the rules and expansions that already exist where possible to simplify the total number of rules required to play.
