Open Fire Skirmish
==================

Skirmish is an expansion for Open Fire that provides additional rules suitable for small scale battles, typically with 5-15 models per army with each acting independently in the fight.

# Additional Rules

## Units and Models

In skirmish games every unit may only contain one model.

## Advanced Movement

### Jumping

Models which wish to move between two areas of terrain at the same height, or to an area 1 height level lower, that is separated by a gap of up to 2 inches may attempt to jump the gap. Move the model to the edge of the terrain you wish to jump from as normal and check to see if the model can make the jump.

Roll a D12 for each inch of distance being jumped (rounding up), if the result is a 1 the model fails the jump and stops it's movement before the gap and it's activation ends.

## Injuries

As models take damage their ability to fight is reduced. In addition to tracking a model's hit points they can also become hurt or wounded You can place a dice beside the model to show this with 1 indicating the model is hurt and 2 indicating it is wounded.

The effect of each injury is cumulative so a model that is wounded also suffers the penalty for being hurt.

### Hurt

Models which have been reduced to below half of their starting hit points become hurt this causes them to suffer a -1 to their movement rate battle skill and defence

### Wounded

Models which are reduced to 1 hit point are become wounded and may not make an attack action if they move. In addition they may not make an advance move during their movement.

### Killing a Model

Models which are reduced to 0 hit points are not automatically killed and may survive to keep fighting. When a model would lose its last hit point instead make a defence test On a successful test the model is restored to 1 hit point, on a failed test the model is removed as a casualty. 

In addition the defence test suffers a negative modifier equal to any excess damage the model would have suffered beyond losing it's last hit point. A roll of a
